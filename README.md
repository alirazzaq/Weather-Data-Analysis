# Weather Data Analysis Project 🌦️

This project is an in-depth analysis of weather data using Python and the Pandas library. 
It explores various weather patterns and statistics, aimed at providing valuable insights 
into weather conditions. This analysis project is part of my commitment to applying 
data science skills acquired from recent certifications.

## 🌟 Motivation
Weather data impacts daily lives, influencing decisions from simple daily routines to 
agricultural planning and disaster preparedness. Analyzing weather trends and patterns 
enables us to understand environmental behaviors, identify climate trends, and potentially 
assist in creating predictive models for better future forecasting.

## 📊 Project Overview
The objective of this project is to analyze a real-world weather dataset to gain insights into weather patterns and conditions. 
This includes analyzing temperature, visibility, humidity, wind speed, and other weather-related variables. 
The following key questions are addressed as part of this analysis:

1. **What are the unique wind speeds recorded in the data?**
2. **How many times was the weather exactly "Clear"?**
3. **What’s the mean visibility across the dataset?**
4. **What is the variance of relative humidity?**
5. **How many instances of foggy weather were recorded?**
